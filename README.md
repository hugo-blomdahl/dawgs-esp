# dawgs-esp
The main repo for the code of the embedded system(s).

## Code standard
Files should start with small letters. Functions and variables should be named using the camelCase standard: `myFunction(int myInput)`. Every function should at least have a brief description of what it does and how it works. It is a good idea to comment author(s) of functions as well. 

Do not put all your code in the main file, call it from there instead.

Commit often, but only when the project compiles correctly and does not crash. Create a pull request to merge to main when something concrete is complete. Especially something that you think will be of use to others :)
